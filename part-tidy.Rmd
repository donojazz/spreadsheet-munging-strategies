# Tidy tables with gotchas {#tidy}

This part is a gentle introduction, by taking what you already know about
importing tidy tabular data (with `read.csv()` or the
[readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org) package), and shows you how to how to do
the same things with [tidyxl](https://nacnudus.github.io/tidyxl) and
[unpivotr](https://nacnudus.github.io/unpivotr).

But even tidy tables can have hidden gotchas, such as meaningful formatting and
sentinel values, so these are covered too.
