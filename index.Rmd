# Welcome {-}

This is a work-in-progress book about getting data out of spreadsheets, nomatter
how peculiar.  The book is designed primarily for R users who have to extract
data from spreadsheets and who are already familiar with the
[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org).  It has a cookbook structure, and can be
used as a reference, but readers who begin in the middle might have to work
backwards from time to time.

R packages that feature heavily are

* [unpivotr](https://nacnudus.github.io/unpivotr): deals with non-tabular data,
  especially from spreadsheets.
* [tidyxl](https://nacnudus.github.io/tidyxl): imports non-tabular data from
  Excel files

Tidyxl and unpivotr are much more complicated than readxl, and thatâ€™s the point.
Tidyxl and unpivotr give you more power and complexity when you need it.

Please help me to improve this book by [opening a GitHub issue]() or [tweeting]().
