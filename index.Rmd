# Welcome {-}

This is the website for a work-in-progress book about getting data out of
spreadsheets, nomatter how peculiar.  The book is designed primarily for R users
who have to extract data from spreadsheets and who are already familiar with
the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org).  It has a cookbook structure, and
can be used as a reference, but readers who begin in the middle might have to
work backwards from time to time.

R packages that feature heavily are

* [unpivotr](https://nacnudus.github.io/unpivotr): tools for converting pivot
  tables into a tidy structure.
* [tidyxl](https://nacnudus.github.io/tidyxl): tools for converting pivot
  tables into a tidy structure.
